Why this works:
Mixes classic structure (features, install, API) with a fresh voice that’s poetic, Gen‑Z, but still respectful of dev traditions.

Leaves creative room for your art: screenshots, emojis, roadmap flair.

Encourages community participation, keeps tone conversational yet informative.

Let me know if you want me to tailor any section—like replacing Node.js with Django, or adding Docker & CI/CD lines.
